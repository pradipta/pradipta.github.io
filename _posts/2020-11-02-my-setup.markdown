This is what my current work setup looks like.

My work laptop is a 16" 16 GB MacBook Pro.

I use the iPhone 12 Pro Max as my primary phone, and I have a Google Pixel 3 XL as my secondary phone.

I also use the iPad Air 4 10.9" (Wifi) to take notes, attend meetings and watch content.

I use a 32 inch [Acer EB321HQ](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/UM.JE1AA.C01).

My desk is a single motor operated sit stand desk from [Fonzel](store.fonzel.com)

I use the [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-in/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005698.html) ~~and the [TVS Gold Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.tvs-e.in/gold/). I have a plan of upgrading to the Keychron K1 TKL~~ and the [Keychron K1 87 Keys](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31253554266201)

For audio I primarily use the [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/in/airpods-pro/). I use the [JBL 750BTNC](https://in.jbl.com/TUNE750BTNC.html) incase I want to use a pair of overhead headphones. I also use a pair of FND 2.1 channel and a Google Home Mini.

I wish to upgrade to a setup with:
<ol>
<li><del>Dual Monitor Setup with a monitor arm</del></li>
<li><del>Keychron K1 / Logitech MX Keys</del></li>
<li><s>Logitech MX Master 2s/3</s></li>
<li>Sony WH1000 XM4</li>
<li><s>A custom self built standing desk</s></li>
<li>A 13 inch laptop on Ubuntu</li>
</ol>
