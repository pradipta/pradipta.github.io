This is what my current work setup looks like.

My work laptop is a 16" 32 GB Macbook Pro (M1 Pro).

I use the iPhone 12 Pro Max as my primary phone, and I have an iPhone SE as my secondary phone.

I also use the iPad Air 4 10.9" (Wifi) to take notes, attend meetings and watch content.

I use two 32 inch [Acer EB321HQU](https://www.acer.com/us-en/monitors/essential/eb1/pdp/UM.JE1AA.C01).

My desk is a single motor operated sit stand desk from [Fonzel](store.fonzel.com)

Mouse: I use the [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-in/products/mice/mx-master-3.910-005698.html) 

Keyboard:
1. [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-in/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical-mini.html) with brown switches.
2. [Nuphy Air 75](https://nuphy.com/collections/keyboards/products/air75) with blue switches and [nSA Shine Through Keycaps](https://nuphy.com/collections/keycaps/products/nsa-shine-through-abs-keycaps).
3. [Royal Kludge RK84 Pro](https://rkgamingstore.com/products/rk84-pro-75-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) with brown switches.

For audio I primarily use the [Apple AirPods Pro](https://www.apple.com/in/airpods-pro/). I use the [Sony WH1000 XM4](https://www.sony.co.in/electronics/headband-headphones/wh-1000xm4) incase I want to use a pair of overhead headphones. I also use a pair of Creative 2.1 channel soundbar on my desk. For microphone and video I use the [Lenovo 300 FHD Webcam](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08KT89BWX/)

I wish to upgrade to a setup with:

<li><del>Dual Monitor Setup with a monitor arm</del></li>
<li>Triple Monitor Setup</li>
<li><del>Keychron K1 / Logitech MX Keys</del></li>
<li><s>Logitech MX Master 2s/3</s></li>
<li><del>Sony WH1000 XM4<del></li>
<li><s>A custom self built standing desk</s></li>

</ol>
