So, here it is. I was working as a Software Engineer 2 for upGrad previously for a few month over a year.
The time I spent there was amazing, and I learned a huge load of stuff, considering it was my first job as an actual developer.

I recently interviewed at a few companies and had offers from Flipkart and Swiggy for the role of an SDE 2. And I decided to join Flipkart.
I started working for Flipkart from the 5th of April 2021. I work for the Fintech and Payments Group, particularly for the Buy Now Pay Later team.

Looking forward to a great tenure at Flipkart.
