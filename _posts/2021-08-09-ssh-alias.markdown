As part of my work I regularly have to SSH into various hosts to perform some actions or to debug issues.
Everytime I do it, I head to our internal cloud dashboard to figure out the IP address of the host that I need to SSH into. There are a few hosts for particular services that I SSH into very frequently, almost on a daily basis.

It is not possible to remember IPs, which look like 10.12.13.14.

Assigning a name is easier. I now have created aliases for my most frequently used hosts.

On the /.zshrc file, I added:

`alias ssh-service-env-zone="ssh ipaddress"`

The next time I wish to SSH into `ipaddress`, I can just do a `ssh-service-env-zone`.

This gets even better with `Auto Suggestions and Syntax Highlighting`. For details check out this [blog](https://pradipta.github.io/terminal-setup-on-mac/)
